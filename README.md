# utryoutform

  This is my first project for AthleTech Software. It is a data collection form I created using PHP, jQuery, 
MySQL, and Bootstrap. The form saves input data into a database using PDO with the singleton design pattern. 
I was able to turn checkboxes and radio buttons into buttons using CSS. The behavior of the buttons 
is driven using jQuery. The form also has a hidden field used for the honeypot method and will redirect any 
spam-bots to the FBI's webpage just for laughs. The information will be used to help create a larger project 
that I am currently working on.
